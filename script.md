As the early stage of this project. The initial goal was to thoroughly understand our data and  create a scalable and modular pipeline that contains all stages of our data processing needs—from data ingestion and preprocessing to feature engineering and model. This wiil allow us to easily adapt by incorporating various features, models, and methodologies by iterations.
