Currently, we are utilizing all available features in NBS 1.0. However, as we transition to NBS 2.0, which is based on deep learning, the model's robustness and performance are less likely to be negatively impacted by a large number of features. Deep learning models, particularly those with well-designed architectures, are capable of handling high-dimensional data and can extract complex patterns and interactions between features. This capability is especially beneficial in contexts where each additional feature can potentially add informative value to the model.
