The identified limitation of the model is its inability to process data in real-time, as it is designed to handle batch data only. However, given that the NBS (National Bureau of Statistics) operates on a monthly schedule and there is currently no strategy in place to transition to real-time data streaming, this limitation is not immediately impactful. Nonetheless, it's worth considering that the landscape of data processing and analytics is evolving, and the ability to process streaming data might become a valuable asset in the future.
