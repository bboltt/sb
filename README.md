# Generating the Top N Clients List

The process of generating the `top_n_clients_list` involves several key steps from data preparation through to the final selection of prospects. Here's a step-by-step breakdown and a visual flowchart illustrating this process:

## Steps Explained

1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Transform raw client data into meaningful features that can be analyzed. This includes metrics like account longevity, transaction volumes, and types of financial products used.

2. **Clustering Existing PWM Clients:**
   - Apply a clustering algorithm to existing PWM clients to identify distinct profiles or groups, represented by cluster centroids.

3. **Calculating Similarity Scores:**
   - For each potential client, calculate similarity scores to each cluster centroid using a distance measure (e.g., cosine similarity).

4. **Ranking and Selecting Top Prospects:**
   - Rank potential clients based on their highest similarity scores to any PWM centroid.

5. **Extracting the Top N Clients:**
   - Select the top N clients with the highest similarity scores as the most prospective PWM clients.

6. **Continuous Refinement:**
   - Continuously update and refine the selection process as new data becomes available and client profiles evolve.
