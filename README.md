# Private Wealth Management Project Demo

## Introduction

Welcome to our Private Wealth Management Project demonstration. Today, we'll discuss the project's architecture, the rationale behind our methodologies, and the structured approach we've adopted to enhance client identification and engagement.

## Project Strategy and Overview

The project is designed with modularity and flexibility in mind, allowing for easy adjustments and scalability. Our initial goal was to thoroughly understand our data and establish a versatile pipeline that accommodates various features and models.

## File Structure and Code Organization

Our project is organized into several Python modules, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the processing pipeline:

- `data_loader.py`:
  - Responsible for loading and preprocessing data from various sources. This includes SQL databases and CSV files, ensuring that the data is clean and formatted correctly for analysis.

- `feature_engineering_pipeline.py`:
  - Contains the `FeatureEngineeringPipeline` class which handles all transformations and feature engineering tasks. This class is crucial for preparing the data by creating meaningful features that are used in the model.

- `model_pipeline.py`:
  - This file includes functions for clustering PWM clients, calculating similarity scores, and ranking potential prospects. It encapsulates the core logic for identifying prospective PWM clients based on their similarity to existing clients.

- `main.py`:
  - The main script that orchestrates the loading, processing, and analysis workflows. It calls functions from other modules to carry out the project's entire pipeline from start to finish.

## High-Level Approach to Identifying Prospects

We utilize advanced analytical techniques to identify potential PWM clients, focusing on similarity calculations and clustering based on engineered features that reflect client behaviors and preferences.

## Methodologies: Similarity Calculation

### Why Use Similarity?
- **Prospect Identification**: Pinpoints individuals who share significant characteristics with our existing private wealth clients, suggesting a higher potential for engagement.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes resource allocation by focusing efforts on the most promising leads, thus enhancing ROI.

## Conclusion

Thank you for attending this demo. We believe that our structured and methodical approach not only enhances our ability to identify high-potential clients but also positions us to dynamically adapt to changes and new opportunities in wealth management.
